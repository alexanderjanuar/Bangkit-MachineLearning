## Image Classification
The models aims to classify images of ornamental plants into different categories using the TensorFlow library and the EfficientNetB3 model. The EfficientNetB3 is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture known for its efficiency and strong performance in image classification tasks.

## Recommendation Engines
This script main focus will be on how to recommend a plant using collaborative filltering. The main idea is to generate personalized plant recommendations based on the similarities and preferences of differenct users.
